## 📸 A Success Story.
**Youssef started learning C++ with me from scratch. Despite being in middle school, he showed incredible enthusiasm, stayed for full sessions, and kept pushing forward. Thanks to his effort and early mentorship, he won the prestigious Al-Quds coding competition, earned a scholarship from the Egyptian Ministry of Communications, and qualified for the National Olympiad in Informatics. I’m truly proud to have been part of his journey. He reminds us that early encouragement can unlock greatness.**

## 🧹 Repository Maintenance
As the repository grows, we will implement regular cleanup using the Purge Repository Data GitHub Action to regularly clean up unnecessary large files, remove sensitive data, and reduce commit history bloat. These automated cleanups help keep the project secure, lightweight, and contributor-friendly, ensuring long-term efficiency and maintainability.

## 🚀 Technical Infrastructure

### Continuous Integration and GitHub Pages
This repository uses GitHub Actions with automatic Jekyll builds to ensure high code quality and seamless deployment. Every change pushed to the main branch triggers an automated process that builds and deploys the site.

### Branch Protection
We've implemented branch protection policies to maintain code quality:

- Required pull request reviews before merging
- Status checks must pass before merging
- Restricted push access to the main branch

## 📦 Managing Large Files with Git LFS
- This repository utilizes [Git Large File Storage (LFS)](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to handle large files efficiently. You must be connected to the internet the first time you try to edit or open any LFS-tracked file.

## ✍️ Contribution Guidelines
You're welcome contributions to improve grammar, format chapters, or add code examples. Read our [CONTRIBUTING.md](./source/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

**📌 Contribution History Note:**

	Starting from v1.1.0, this project adopted a structured PR-based Fork Workflow.
Earlier commits (before v1.1.0) represent initial content uploads and direct fixes made during the bootstrap phase.
All future contributions follow a professional pull request process with clearly versioned releases.
